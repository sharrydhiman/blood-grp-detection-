# Blood Group Detection using AI and Machine Learning


## Overview

This project focuses on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect and classify blood groups accurately. The aim is to streamline medical diagnostics and enhance healthcare workflows through automated blood group identification.

## Features

- Utilizes state-of-the-art image processing techniques.
- Implements machine learning models for precise blood group classification.
- Improves accuracy and efficiency in blood group detection.
- Streamlines medical processes with automated analysis.

## Dataset

We employed a comprehensive dataset containing images of blood samples representing various blood groups: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-. The dataset was carefully curated to ensure diverse and representative samples for training and testing our models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib


## Results

Our models achieved an accuracy rate of over 75% in blood group classification on unseen data. The inference time for detecting blood groups was significantly reduced, leading to faster medical diagnostics and improved patient care.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement real-time blood group detection for medical devices.
- Explore object segmentation techniques to enhance classification accuracy.
- Collaborate with healthcare institutions for real-world deployment.
